# CHANGELOG

The change log for the Rust [socketcan](https://crates.io/crates/socketcan) library.

## [Version 2.1.0](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/compare/v2.0.0..v2.1.0)  (2023-09-19)

- Made `CanAddr` pulic and added functions to help interact with low-level sockaddr types. Sockets can now be opened with an address.
- Can create an `Error` directly from a `CanErrorFrame` or `std::io::ErrorKind`.
- [#46](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/issues/46)  Applications can create error frames:
    - `CanErrorFrame::new()` now works.
    - `CanErrorFrame::new_error()` is similar but more intuitive using a raw ID word.
    - `From<CanError> for CanErrorFrame` to create an error frame from a `CanError`.
- Added `Frame::from_raw_id()` and `Frame::remote_from_raw_id()`
- Bumped MSRV to 1.65.0
