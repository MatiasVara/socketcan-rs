Rust SocketCAN support
======================

The Linux kernel supports using CAN-devices through a network-like API
(see https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/can.txt). This
crate allows easy access to this functionality without having to wrestle
libc calls.

Please see the [documentation](https://docs.rs/socketcan) for details.
